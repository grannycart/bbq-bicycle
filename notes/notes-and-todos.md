# BBQ Bicycle --- Notes and Todos


## Production notes
* [ ] Consider: maybe bbq bicycle shouldn't be a website. (Or at least not a website-first.)
	* Maybe like other manifestos it should be a short pdf, say 20-40k words, that can be shared around hand-to-hand among those in the know. 
	* (Perhaps keep in mind formatting it for phone though -- narrow small pages in the pdf? Or maybe give an option in the build to build compile it for phone or letter pages)
	* Cricket says she would like to illustrate.
* [X] Register bbqbike.net .com
* Decide if you want to have a tone of directly addressing the reader ("you") or more generalized. (More generalized would feel more like a manifesto. But maybe would be less accessible.)
* perhaps even more of an audience/demand than for cities?
	* not quite the demand for food writing, but it's there?
	* On the other hand, there are already a lot of bicycle writers out there
	* On the plus side, this stuff should be easy to write, and can be used as published examples for applying to jobs
	* Add this to notes in writing todos, or meta, wherever that stuff is about food writers
* Lines beginging with a + [ ] are actual sentence framings
* Ideally, each of these should be about 700 words
	* ~2.5 minutes to read 700 words
	* 10 minutes to read 2000 words
* Logo: a person riding a steel bike with a basket and a saddlebag and 1-1 gear uphill
* Put a short paragraph at the top (of every entry?) That explains the idea and links to the TOC. And brands the concept.

## Promotion
* BBQ Bicycle (not barbeque bicycle) because you can do backronyms:
	* Better Be Quiet
	* Better Because it's quiet
* "Today is a fine day to ride!"
* [ ] reach out to that worlds-fastest-women land-speed record for bicycle holder, and get an endorsement from her


## Other bike stuff:
* [ ] there should be a bike path running the length of fire island 
	* right over the route that Moses laid down for his never-built highway
	* There is no easy and safe way to ride the length of long island, this route would help open that up
	* As awesome as fire island is, and as much as I would never want to bring cars to it, the majesty of riding without cars should be accessible to everyone.
	* I know this could never be done today over the opposition of the rich people who live out there.
	* And the idea of roadies cranking down the length of the island where people generally ride rusty old beaters is noisome. This might be mitigated with design though: bollards, regular hard turns, etc. The idea is connectivity and distance without cars, not speed.
	* And today we face the problem that personal electric vehicles could become something of a misery on a cross-island path
		* if you can use path design to keep the speed down for roadies, maybe you can do the same for PEVs?
		* It's hard to imagine someone choosing a small PEV loaded up with a trailer or something as a car-replacement option for getting to their summer home rather than taking the ferry, but maybe this could be the future?
* [ ] Draw your "pedestrian safety" poster
	Every year X pedestrians are killed in NYC, and X nationwide. The leading cause of traffic deaths in NYC is pedestrians.
	When you are out walking, make sure you stay safe!
	By:
		Always wear a helmet
		Wear bright reflective clothes
			(reflecty vest)
		If walking at night, be bright! always wear a white front light, and a rear red light.
		Carry a whistle in your mouth to alert drivers you are around
		Carry a 12 foot orange flag
		Carry a can of pepper spray for personal safety and defense.
		Always cross to the other side of the street from where people are walking
* [ ] Add Bonnie&Clyde and jake braking to Urban Dictionary
* [ ] Finish and submit bicycling in NYC is safe to NY times
	* [ ] (or at least re-read drafts, maybe they should be included here?)
* Mauna Kea
	* Like the Dopesmoker of bicycle rides --- the lowest and the slowest
	* Ride Fuji: change out front chainring to a 22t 1:1? Would that do it? Test in the catskills
	* Always wanted to go to Hawaii, but didn't want to be a tourist. (Well, I AM a tourist, but of a different stripe.)
	* Description of the ride from Hilo to Mauna Kea
