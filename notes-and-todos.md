# BBQ Bicycle --- Notes and Todos
* [ ] Consider: maybe bbq bicycle shouldn't be a website. (Or at least not a website-first.)
	* Maybe like other manifestos it should be a short pdf, say 20-40k words, that can be shared around hand-to-hand among those in the know. 
	* (Perhaps keep in mind formatting it for phone though -- narrow small pages in the pdf? Or maybe give an option in the build to build compile it for phone or letter pages)
	* Cricket says she would like to illustrate.
* [-] Build bbq bike on Medium? (write content first) -- I think not.
* [ ] Register bbqbike.net .com
* [ ] write up the literal bbq bike description (It's a section in the bbq bike topics list)
* [ ] Finish and submit bicycling in NYC is safe to NY times
* [ ] Maybe add Some things like:
	* BBQ bike is good for city riding too:
		* You get the fastest starts out of a stop light with your low gear:
			* Cheeses off all the roadies who *always* forget to shift down before coming to a stop
			* Plus: "I'm already through the intersection on my sneaker-ready pedals, and you're still trying to get clipped in"
				* Sometimes racing gear doesn't actually make you faster
		* Keeps your top speed low:
			* This will almost certainly do more for your safety than a helmet ever will.
			* Cheeses off all the aholes on electric bikes
* [ ] Draw your "pedestrian safety" poster
	Every year X pedestrians are killed in NYC, and X nationwide. The leading cause of traffic deaths in NYC is pedestrians.
	When you are out walking, make sure you stay safe!
	By:
		Always wear a helmet
		Wear bright reflective clothes
			(reflecty vest)
		If walking at night, be bright! always wear a white front light, and a rear red light.
		Carry a whistle in your mouth to alert drivers you are around
		Carry a 12 foot orange flag
		Carry a can of pepper spray for personal safety and defense.
		Always cross to the other side of the street from where people are walking
* [ ] Write "How to love riding your bike"
	This could/should also be part of bbqbike
* [ ] Add Bonnie&Clyde and jake braking to Urban Dictionary
