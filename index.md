First, know that the BBQ Bike is a bicycle --- not a motorcycle, not an e-bike, not a food truck. It's actually not even a bicycle, but a different approach to _bicycling_ than what you might get from advertising from the bike industry or even well-meaning bike-nerd friends. There are many aspects that contribute to the BBQ Bike style of riding, but the biggest distinction is speed: the first thing we're going to do is throw out the idea that you want to go as fast as possible. (footnote: If you want to go fast, get a motorcycle. The pleasure of speed are real, so go to the source.)
