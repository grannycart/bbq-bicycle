## Manifesto 
I am fundamentally a lazy daydreamer. Like most adults, there are many
demands on my time, and most of those demands I would rather actually
not be doing. For many of them I happily escape by daydreaming about
something else while I do them. I know this goes against everything
you might hear these days about the importance of being "mindful"
or "present" in your daily activities, but as a proponent of lazy
daydreaming, I'm going to recommend the exact opposite. That is what
this series is about --- making space for lazy daydreaming in your life.
And after years of dedicated research and experimentation, I have found
that lazy daydreaming is best pursued on a bicycle.

Now most people probably do not associate bicycle riding with being
lazy, nor with the pleasures of letting one's mind wander and your
imagination to run wild. Most people think of bicycle riding as
hard exercise, pursued by dedicated individuals, in pursuit of
ever-increasing performance, fitness, and competitiveness. A few
other people view the bicycle as a utilitarian tool that gets you
to work and back in a cheap and efficient manner. Certainly bicycle
riding encompasses those things. But the reason we think of bicycles
as aggressive machines of fitness or practical transportation is only
because those are the forms of cycling put out into the world by
cycling's most outspoken advocates --- racers and bike nerds.

Bicycling is so much bigger and more important than spandex-clad racing,
or feats of super-human endurance and technical skill, or human-powered
eco-alternatives. Cycling is bigger than any bicycle "culture" --- just
as cars occupy a place in our lives and culture that is much bigger
than the racers and car-nerds who are obsessed with them. The bicycle
is a pure Platonic form. It wasn't invented, it was _discovered_. It
isn't a product of human ingenuity, it's a human-made machine that
plugs into some strange and weird behavior of the universe in a unique
and somewhat mystical way. Motorcycles share a lot of this mystique
(something I'll address in more detail in another essay) but you don't
just sit on a bicycle and tell it where to go. It is much more deeply
connected to you because you are the animal that controls and powers
it. It is what the band Kraftwerk was talking about when singing about
the man-machine, super-human being. There is magic in the physics of
two-wheeled vehicles that researchers and scientists have difficulty
explaining. This magic is in its purest form in a bicycle, and the magic
is there for everyone to use. You just need to grab hold of it, and in
this series I'll show you how.

But this series is not just about leveraging the magic of bicycles (the
racers and bike-nerds are certainly capable of that) but making the most
of bicycles while:
1. respecting your right to be lazy, and 
2. promoting the importance of mind-wandering and daydreaming.

To achieve this, this series will focus primarily on changing the _way_
you think about riding. (Or, if you are a beginner, helping you avoid
getting sucked into competitive or focused riding.) This is pretty
abstract stuff, but eventually this series will cover more practical
ground about changing some of the things you might think about the bike
you ride and the gear you bring.

The biggest emphasis for this BBQBicycle series is simple: just ride
slower. That's the BBQ part --- low and slow is the way to go. Respect
your laziness, don't push yourself too hard. Chill out and ride. Easy
enough, right? But those of you who know BBQ know that going low and
slow takes a long time. This is the other big emphasis: spend more
time on your bicycle. More time on your bicycle is more time to
daydream and let your mind wander. To spend a lot of time on your
bicycle, you need to be comfortable though, and that is where the
practical matters like what bike you ride, and what gear you bring
come into play.

I am of those who believe that a true manifesto should have numbered
statements with descriptive annotations. And so, I present the
BBQBicycle manifesto:

1. *Low and slow is the way to go.* Just. Ride. Slower. That's the
first rule. Try to keep your heart rate under 60% of your capacity,
even on the steepest hills. (BBQBicycle will have tips for achieving
this.) If that's too technical for you, try comparing your bike riding
to a walk or a hike --- don't ever ride your bike at a level where you
are doing more work than you would be if you were hiking up the same
terrain. The main reason for this is riding too hard will distract you
from the main reason you are out there --- to daydream. But also,
a lazy person doesn't want to do hard exercise.
2. *Daydreaming is a critical part of riding.*
3. *Ride by yourself.* This is a critical to daydreaming. You can't
daydream while talking to other people.
4. *Feel the pure mechanical pleasure of riding.*
5. *Seek out the climbs.* It's very simple: going uphill forces you to
go low and slow.



## Step 1: Go on Vacation

This entry is for the person who hasn't been on a bicycle since they
were a kid. The basic principles of BBQBicycle can apply to any rider,
but in the interests of accessibility (and stepping outside of "bike
culture") let's start at the beginning. If you are more experienced,
you can probably skip Step 1 --- but heck, nothing wrong with going on
vacation!

I am going to assume here that you know at least _how_ to ride
a bicycle. If you don't, in many places adult riding classes are
available, and you should totally go do one! They are extremely
rewarding and confidence-building.

If you haven't ridden a bicycle much since you were a kid, the first
thing you should do is go on vacation. Not just any vacation, you want
to look for a very specific and special place: the beach community. 

All around the world, there are small beach communities where, because
the weather is generally pleasant (otherwise, why have a beach there?)
and because they are small, one of the main forms of transportation will
find is the "beach cruiser" bicycle. The beach cruiser is big. It's
heavy. It has super-fat squishy tires and one gear with the kind of
brake you pedal backwards to stop. It's got super-wide handle bars, and
a huge squishy seat for American butts. If you're lucky, it will also
be old and super rusty too. In short, it is the very antithesis of the
bicycle that racers and bike-nerds favor. To them, the beach cruiser is
barely a bicycle at all.

But in many ways, the beach cruiser is the pinnacle of bicycles.
They are dead simple, ultra-comfortable over short distances, nearly
indestructible, and since they are seen as low-value, they are rarely
stolen. In many beach communities you don't even need to lock up your
beach cruiser. With a beach cruiser, you don't have to think about
_anything_ else. Just get on the bike and ride. And while you're riding,
you don't have to think about riding. Instead think about your day at
the beach ahead of you. Or the ice cream you will eat later. This is how
all riding should be, but so rarely is. Try very hard to remember what
that feels like because you want to bring that feeling back home with
you. This is the feeling of bike riding that you will be trying to
achieve in any other kind of riding you do.*

Take your beach cruise out and ride around town with no plan. Except,
look for an ice cream stand. Stop for ice cream and leave your bike
unlocked and propped on the kickstand. Get an ice cream cone. Get back
on your bike and eat your ice cream cone _while_ you ride your bike.
This is good practice for riding in general, but you won't realize
that because all the fun you're having will blind you to any practical
effects. 

While on vacation, ride your beach cruiser everywhere. To the
store, to visit friends, on the boardwalk at sunset, and of course throw
a towel in the basket (get one with a basket, for sure) and ride to the
beach. After the beach, go out and get really drunk. (Or get drunk on
the beach! In many places, that's allowed.) After you are fairly
seriously drunk, get on your bike and ride home. Try to be drunk
enough that you are at serious risk of crashing. Try to get into
a minor crash on the way home. There's two reasons for this:
1. The bike is a beach cruiser --- it will be _fine_ after a crash.
2. Crashing will help you internalize what it's like to fall off
a bike. Falling off a bike as an adult almost never happens. But you
know what? When it does, it's really not that bad. Typically you get
a minor scrape or two. The kind would would have just shrugged off as
a kid, but as an adult for some reason we take dramatic steps to avoid
on all occasions. A couple of good falls will help you feel more
confident on the bike, because you'll realize that falling isn't
something to be too scared of. Being drunk helps a lot in trying to
crash and fall.

After a week or two of transiting around a beach town on a bicycle
without ever stepping into a car, you'll be ready for bigger things on
the bicycle. And that's when you want to start thinking about your
next steps to get you riding every day in your normal non-vacation
life. Every time you get on your bike, try to feel a little bit of
that feeling of beach-cruiser riding while on vacation.



*As an aside, this feeling of no-brainer bicycling is a critical element
to improving our cities --- imagine what would happen if that feeling of
traveling around a beach community on a beach cruiser bicycle were what
it felt like to travel around _any_ city or town in the US? It would
be a revolution in transportation. It would be a huge reduction in
stress, and increase in public health. And, most importantly, it would
just make our lives much more fun to live.


## Riding and Thinking

It is a cliche that people get some of their best thinking done in the
shower. And I'm not going to argue with that cliche. It's cliche
because it's true! But there's a problem with shower-thinking, and
that is that you just can't spend that much time in the shower.
Particularly in parts of the world where water is a limited resource.
For most people, 15 minutes is a long shower. So what you are saying
when you say you do your best thinking in the shower is that you are
spending _only_ 15 minutes a day doing your best thinking. It is
therefore incumbent on us to figure out another way to capture that
shower brainspace -- and the way to do that is on a bicycle.

But before we get to bicycles, let's pull apart _why_ shower thinking
is so good. There's a few elements that are fairly unique to
showers:
1. Showers give you something to do physically that requires almost no
conscious mental space.
2. Because of this, you are active and motivated, but not obligated to
be working through anything.
3. Typically, you have given yourself permission to let your mind
wander in the shower.
This series of things means that you have a rare state of consciousness
without concentration. Consciousness without concentration is the key.
The simple activities required in the shower, and the shower of water
itself, will keep you awake and alert, but your mind is free to
daydream up new ideas, make connections to solve problems, or create
fantasies that do nothing more than keep you entertained.
If you go into a shower with a problem you need to solve, you will
often find that the solution will come to you, seemingly out of
nowhere. This is sort of a corollary to the concept of 'flow' where
you immerse yourself in concentration on a project. Instead, in the
shower you have freed yourself from concentration, and new connections
are free to be made.

The bicycle offers a similar brainspace --- but only if you know how
to access it. You have to let the baggage of expectation go. The bike
culture world endorses the idea of tracking your performance with your
phone or cyclocomputers. They push the idea that you should ride fast,
get your heart rate up, seek out new challenges, ride with friends so
you can achieve higher speeds through collaborative aerodynamics. None
of this stuff is bad in and of itself, but all of it requires
concentration. Like in the shower, a BBQBicyclist wants to avoid
concentration. For this reason the three key components of BBQBicycling
are:
1. Ride slower
2. Ride by yourself
3. Go for longer rides
Just the fact that you are out doing a mild physical activity will get
you into an awake and alert state, like in the shower. It's up to you
to not let yourself be distracted into concentration though, and the
way to do that is not to push yourself physically --- because then you
will be thinking about pushing yourself --- and to ride alone so you
are in your own headspace, not someone else's.

You might think that this is no different than driving your car. But
driving a car is incredibly passive. Most of the time in a car you
move into a resting state, that is unquestionably pleasant, but
doesn't lend itself to creative and clear daydreaming. In a car you
"zone out." On a bicycle, you are not constrained by zones.

How about walking? Walking is the next-best thing. It is also a good
way to achieve the consciousness without concentrating state. But
there's some (relatively minor) drawbacks to walking that make
bicycles a better choice:
* Walking can be very hot, on a bicycle you generate your own breeze.
* Walking more than a few miles can tend to be uncomfortable. You can
get blisters, sore feet and legs, and your fingers swell up.
* On a bicycle you get the bonus of the pure mechanical pleasure of
riding.
Still, if walking is your thing by all means engage with it. Almost
all of the BBQBicycle principles apply to walking as well. Bicycles
are just a bit better.

And that brings us to the core component of BBQBicycling: ride longer.
If you aren't used to longer rides, start with a ten mile ride. Create
a loop from your house that goes out and back 5 miles. That way if
anything goes wrong, you'll be likely to be close enough to your house
to walk back. (And if you are precisely 5 miles away when something
goes wrong, you can call for a ride from someone who is unlikely to be
very put out having to only drive 5 miles to pick you up.)

Once you're comfortable with 10 miles, up it to 20. Then 50. Between
20-50 miles you will be spending _hours_ on your bicycle --- imagine
the quality of shower thinking for hours on end. This is the basic
reward of the BBQBicycle.



## Low and slow is the way to go

The thing that makes it a BBQBicycle is very simple: it's a good bike
for riding slow. This is achieved by a combination of two things:
1. A bicycle that is set up for riding slowly.
2. Your _own willingness_ to ride slowly.

The mechanical part of building a bike that is good for riding slowly
is easy compared to developing your own willingness to ride slowly.
The problem is that bicycles are _super_ efficient forms of
transportation. [Might want to look up and cite some science on this
here.] You wouldn't think it, but the extreme efficiency of bicycles
actually creates problems for riders, and those problems fall into two
big categories:
1. Riding a bicycle takes so little energy that many people who get
onto a bicycle sort of instinctively expect it to do _all_ the work,
like a car. And they are subtly disappointed when it doesn't, so they
switch to an electric scooter or something. The BBQBicycle rider
revels in how easy it is to ride a bicycle, and makes the most of that
to spend their time daydreaming.
2. Riding a bicycle takes so little energy that riders (particularly
riders who really get into it) can push themselves far beyond their
normal physical capacities -- and so make cycling extremely hard. This
is the "it never gets easier, it only gets faster" phenomenon. The
BBQBicycle rider must not succumb to this temptation.

The BBQBicycle tries to find the middle ground between these two
things. Well, not the middle exactly, maybe a step above #1, and
a long way to go to #2. That ground is covered by riding slowly,
without too much effort, but steadily for a significant period of
time. It is low geared, slow riding, and you will have a way to go.

So how slow is slow? This is tough because it's going to be different
for everyone depending on your fitness and abilities. But it is best
measured by your heart rate and respiration. If you are out on a ride
for an hour or more, the BBQBicyclist aims to spend about 80-90% of that
ride pedaling steadily, but not enough to really raise your heart rate
significantly. Basically, you want to be doing about the same amount of
work as you would do at your average walking speed. The magic of the
bicycle is that your average walking speed amount of work will be _much_
faster on a bicycle. Just to get _some_ kind of fitness improvement
out of your time on the bicycle, you want to spend 10-20% of your
time with a somewhat raised heart rate -- maybe about 60% of your
maximum. Small hills tend to be good for this. Every once in a while,
you may find it is nice to crank things up, and really push yourself
up into your maximum capacity, and see how fast you can go. There's
nothing wrong with this, and it can be good for giving yourself
a mind-clearing reset, but if straining at your limit on a bicycle and
going fast is the thing you enjoy on your bicycle, you should join up
with a road riding crew, and stop reading this now.





Also: Learn to RIDE your bike. Many people just pedal until they are
moving, and then coast. This is fine if you are just doing an
oceanside ride on a boardwalk, but if you want to get anywhere you
need to start pedaling more. Not like you need to push yourself until
you are the edge of your capabilities, but for actually traveling
somewhere by bicycle, and for making it an effective exercise, you
need to pedal at about the same exertion level as going on
a reasonable walk. Basically, you should only be coasting when you are
slowing down, or traveling downhill. Any time you can put some effort
into the pedals, you should be turning them. The problem is that bike
riding is SO easy, that people get on their bike and expect to put out
the same energy as driving a car --- which is none. Remember that you
want to be putting out the same energy as a moderate walk. And the
magic of a bicycle is that it will turn that moderate walk energy into
a travel distance equivalent to, if not more than, a car (in a dense
city anyway).



## What bike should you ride?

Now you have a sense of _why_ BBQBicycle might be for you. But _how__
do you actually do it?

And the first part of how is: what bike do I ride? The answer that is
pretty much any bike you have in the garage or locked up in the bike
room of your building! The less like a fancy modern road bike the
better. Probably the best bet is if you have an old mountain bike or
"hybrid" that doesn't have shocks on it. These bikes are great because
they have very little that can go wrong with them (that's the problem
with shocks) and they are already set up with low gears. As you might
imagine, low gears are helpful if you want to ride low and slow.

Before you go for your first ride on your bike that you haven't pulled
out in 6 months or more, put air in your tires. Putting air in your
tires is one of the few not-magic things about bike riding. It sucks.
But you want to do it for two reason:
1. Tires that are up to pressure will make it _way_ easier to ride.
2. Tires that don't have enough air in them are one of the main causes
of flats. You don't want to deal with a flat on your first ride, it
will be discouraging.

Putting air in tires isn't hard, but it also isn't as simple as is
commonly thought. You should probably check out a few instruction videos
or guides to make sure you are doing it correctly. Following good
instructions on the internet is the way to go, but here's two things
you need to know immediately:
1. You can't tell how much air is in the tire by feeling the tire. You
have to have a pressure gauge.
2. You can't use an air hose for a car -- cars have like 35 pounds of
air pressure in them.* A very low pressure bicycle tire (for adults)
would be 45. Most bicycles want 80-100 pounds of pressure, and for
that you want a dynamite-detonator-style floor pump (with a gauge).
It's ok to use the air hose at your bike shop though -- that will
probably be set at 80 or 90 psi.

Once you have your tires to the right pressure, get on your bike and
ride!

For your first ride, just go a couple of miles. Don't just go around
the block --- that isn't a couple of miles. But ride downtown and
back, say, or across that long bridge, or circle your whole
neighborhood. Maybe check on a map to see how far a mile around your
house is. You might be surprised what you can reach in
a mile-out-mile-back ride. 

Two miles is going to take even the slowest rider a wopping 15 minutes.
So assuming nothing terrible happened to you on your first ride, go
right back out and ride a second ride! Depending on how comfortable
you are feeling, this time plan to ride 5-10 miles. 10 miles on a slow
ride will take a little more than an hour. Avoid hills for now, and pick
a route you know well.



[Cover gearing here]




*An odd corollary to the fact that you can't use an air hose for a car
is that you absolutely _can_ use a bike pump to bring up the pressure in
your car tires. Give it a try next time you want to add some pressure to
your car. It only takes a few pumps in most cases to raise your car tire
by 5 psi. You don't want to fill a completely flat care tire with a bike
pump, but just topping it off is faster with a bike pump, you can do it
in your driveway or wherever your car is parked, and will save you a few
quarters.




## What to know before you go
